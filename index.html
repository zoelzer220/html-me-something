      <p>Each day kids are seeing, hearing or experincing something new. They are trying to figure out how the world works, while at the same time learning the expectations you have of them. Life can seem overwhelming &amp; complicated, similar to how we feel sometimes. Cut them some slack.</p>

      <p>If they are acting like a mad(wo)man -- they are probably hungry. If its close to mealtime or they haven't ate in awhile they are probably hungry. If they see a snack they want or get reminded of food they will probably be hungry.</p>
