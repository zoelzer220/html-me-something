    <h1>Parenting Toddlers 101</h1>
    <p>Kids are nuts. They will drive you absolutely crazy, but they are oh so rewarding. These 7 reminders will help you rock the parenting game.</p>

    <h2>1. Have patience.</h2>
    <p>Kids can sense when you are high-strung, they feed off your energy. They also seem to take the opportunity to strike when you are weak. Take a deep breath, you can do this! When they are out of earshot you can scream or express any frustration .</p>
  
    <h2>2. Put yourself in their shoes.</h2>
    <p>Almost everything around them is new. They are trying to figure out how the world works, while at the same time learning how to pee on the potty. Life can seem overwhelming and complicated, similar to how we feel sometimes. Cut them some slack.</p>

    <h2>3. Let them teach you.</h2>
    <p>Understand that they have just as much to teach you as you have to teach them. Let their sense of wonder inspire you. Appreciate the little things. Get excited about a popsicle.</p>   

    <h2>4. Remember they get hangry just like we do.</h2>
    <p>If they are acting like a mad(wo)man -- they are probably hungry. If its close to mealtime or they haven't ate in awhile they are probably hungry. If they see a snack they want or get reminded of food they will probably be hungry.</p>   

    <h2>5. Take things one step at a time.</h2>
    <p>Things seem so much easier when you look at them in smaller pieces. If you focus on one step they are more likely to listen.</p>  
    
    <h2>6. Acknowledge your emotions.</h2>
    <p>It's okay to be sad or mad or even angry. You're entitled to you own feelings, just like we teach our children. However, the part that matters is realizing them and handling them in a constructive manner. It's amazing what a deep breath can do.</p>

    <h2>7. Have fun!</h2>
    <p>Don't take life to seriously. Take time to enjoy it, have fun with your babes. Do a funny dance. Play dress up. Sing at the top of your lungs.</p>



    <p>This list isn't exhaustive but it can lead you on your way to earning parent of the year, even if it's just in the eyes of your little one.</p>
