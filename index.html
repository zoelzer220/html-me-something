      <h2>1. Have patience.</h2>

      <h2>2. Put yourself in their shoes.</h2>
      <p>Almost everything around them is new. They are trying to figure out how the world works, while at the same time learning how to pee on the potty. Life can seem overwhelming &amp; complicated, similar to how we feel sometimes. Cut them some slack.</p>

      <h2>3. Let them teach you.</h2>
      <p>Understand that they have just as much to teach you as you have to teach them. Let their sense of wonder inspire you. Appreciate the little things. Get excited about sharing some fruit snacks.</p>

      <h2>4. Remember they get hangry just like we do.</h2>
      <p>If they are acting like a mad(wo)man -- they are probably hungry. If its close to mealtime or they haven't ate in awhile they are probably hungry. If they see a snack they want or get reminded of food they will probably be hungry.</p>

      <h2>5. Take things one step at a time.</h2>
      <p>Things seem so much easier when you look at them in smaller pieces. If you focus on one step they are more likely to listen.</p>

      <h2>6. Acknowledge your emotions.</h2>
      <p>It's okay to be sad or mad or even angry. You're entitled to you own feelings, just like we teach our children. However, the part that matters is realizing them &amp; handling them in a constructive manner. It's amazing what a deep breath can do.</p>

      <p>Don't take life to seriously. Take time to enjoy it, have fun with your babes. Do a funny dance. Play dress up. Sing at the top of your lungs.</p>
